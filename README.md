# Web Dev 2 - Promises Exercise

This is similar to the previous Callbacks Exercise but this time you need to use `then-catch` and `async/await` methods

## Instructions

1. Modify `file_reader.js` so that it can read the data from:
  
    - firstname.txt
    - lastname.txt
    - age.txt
    - hobbies.txt

2. Using **then-catch** and **async/await**, read one file at a time and at the end, console.log the sentence `John Smith is 50 years old and his hobbies are swimming and dancing` on the terminal
3. You should have two console.logs, one for the `then-catch` solution and the other for the `async/await` solution
4. Commit and push your changes

## Notes

Convert the data inside `hobbies.txt` to an array and select each hobby using their index. For example, `hobbies[0]` and `hobbies[1]`
